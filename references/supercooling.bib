	abstract = {Supercooling is an undesired property of phase change materials due to the poorly predictable occurrence of crystallization during cooling. For such situations, the stored latent heat cannot be recovered which can be an issue for temperature-controlled applications. This review illustrates the techniques used for triggering crystallization in phase change materials having a supercooling property. The development of triggering devices should constitute a breakthrough for heat on demand applications, as heat can be released even when the temperature drops far below the liquidus temperature. Several techniques appear to be promising for nucleation triggering. They have been classified into two categories: passive (reduction of supercooling) or active (triggering of crystallization on demand) devices. They were accurately investigated for water freezing for: meteorological comprehension, food preservation or the pharmaceutical industry. In this paper, several nucleating agents (passive) have been explored, and most of them, added by 1 wt\%, can decrease the supercooling degree by more than 90\%. In addition, the heat would be immediately released on demand from a supercooled material by the use of seeding or electrofreezing (active methods). Solidification can also be externally triggered by the application of high pressure or ultrasonic waves (active). In addition to the analysis of the efficiency of the different techniques in terms of supercooling reduction, this review also discusses the solidification process at a microscopic scale.},

Dans cette communication, on décrit : (1) les caractéristiques d'écoulement d'un coulis de glace diphasique dans un système à accumulation thermique de glace surfondue ; (2) des modèles d'analyse numérique pour les procédés d'accumulation et de fusion de glace dans des réservoirs ; et (3) les technologies utilisées pour la conception des systèmes d'accumulation de glace fondée sur des modèles prévisionnels, ainsi que les performances des systèmes conçus ainsi lors de leur fonctionnement. Grâce à ce développement, les auteurs ont pu confirmer que les approches prévisionnelles de l'accumulation de glace unidimensionnelle dans les réservoirs en question et de la fusion de glace dans de l'eau à une température suffisamment basse pour les applications de conditionnement d'air sont faisables et utilisables à grande échelle. En outre, dans les conditions de conception utilisées ici, il s'avère possible de simplifier la construction des réservoirs d'accumulation de glace et d'obtenir une grande fiabilité des équipements dans la pratique.},

By raising IPF and reducing mass flow rate of supplying ice-slurry, the ice-rich layer was hard spreading horizontally in the tank. The overall porosity of the ice-rich layer was converging to the value of 0.8–0.9 in the ice storing process. The analytical results of the shape of the ice-rich layer agreed fairly with the experimental results, by modeling the change of water permeability in the ice-rich layer in the tank. This analytical model is considered to be applicable to the design of ice storage tanks in DHC.},

The results have shown the difficulty to control a plant where the supercooling phenomenon is undergoing. The stochastic character of the crystallization interferes with the reproducibility of the results. However, the experiments showed that it is possible to find operating parameters with enough safety margin to avoid the crystallization inside the tube of the exchanger.

When the ice blockage happens in one of the supercooled heat exhcangers, the ice generator can continue to work by switching to another one instead of stopping work, assuring the continuous ice making. The outstanding highlight of this ice generator is that the ice blockage that happened in one of the supercooled heat exchangers can be melted by the hot refrigerant gas without extra heater. In this paper, the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the heat exchanger are simulated by providing guidance for experimental studies. Based on the results of simulation and the theoretical studies, a series of experiments are conducted. Although the ice blockage cannot be thoroughly resolved, the results show that it is a practical and efficient method of ice generation system. This work provides theoretical and experimental basis and is practical for the improvement of ice generator using supercooled water; in addition, the ice blockage is retarded, improving the ice production.},

Unfortunately, the role of shear rates in affecting the ice growth rate and the underlying microscopic mechanisms are not well understood. In this work, we investigate the ice growth rate in shear flows through molecular dynamics simulations. Under sufficient supercooling, it is found that the growth rate varies nonlinearly as the shear rate is increased and assumes a maximum at an intermediate shear rate. This is caused by two distinct effects of the shear on the ice crystallization. On the one hand, a shear can help break the hydrogen bond network (HBN) in water and free some water molecules to reorganize at the water–ice interface to form ice. On the other hand, the shear can also disrupt the water–ice hydrogen bonds and thus hinder the growth of ice. At low shear rates, the former effect is important, while the latter influence becomes dominant at high shear rates. The competition of these two effects leads to the nonlinear dependence. Close to the melting point, however, the thermal effect weakens the role of the shear rate in promoting ice growth, and the growth rate shows monotonous decrease with increasing shear rate.},

In this work, we investigate the homogeneous ice nucleation rate under shear through molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that the ice nucleation rate changes nonlinearly with varying shear rates and reaches a maximum at an intermediate shear rate. Such a behavior is determined by two distinct effects of shear rates. On the one hand, shear increases the free energy barrier for the nucleation, which hinders the ice nucleation. On the other hand, shear enhances the diffusion of water molecules, assists the adsorption of water molecules on the ice nucleus, and consequently promotes the growth of ice nucleus. The latter effect dominates at low shear rates, while the former effect becomes significant at high shear rates. The competition between these two effects leads to a non-monotonic dependence of the ice nucleation rate on the shear rate.},
