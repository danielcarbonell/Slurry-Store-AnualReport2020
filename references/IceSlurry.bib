	abstract = {Ice slurry is an exciting fluid. It is often called a secondary refrigerant or a heat transfer fluid, because it does not evaporate inside the heat exchanger like refrigerants do. But looking at the energy density and the heat transfer characteristics, ice slurry is on eye level with many {HFC} refrigerants. Ice slurry can be used inside heat exchangers and in direct contact cooling, offering many interesting areas such as fish or produce chilling. In addition, it can be used for pipe cleaning or for pushing (pigging) precious products out of pipes without significant product loss. Ice slurry has evolved from a niche product into a technology applied in many fields. Nonetheless, developing efficient ice slurry production, effective ice slurry storage and reliable ice and additive concentration measurements as well as crystal growth issues remain challenging tasks for engineers. The paper suggests future research.},

	abstract = {The performance of conventional, water based, solar thermal collectors is limited by some intrinsic limitations, such as the need for high irradiation levels and the heat loss due to the relatively high temperature of the heat transfer fluid. In order to overcome these limitations and to improve the performance of solar thermal collectors, a different kind of heat transfer fluid can be proposed. This fluid is based on the exploitation of the latent heat of fusion/solidification of suspended particles, which change their state of aggregation at a micron scale, but maintain the liquid state of the fluid at a macroscopic scale. The so-called slurry phase materials, or PCS, are examples of this kind of material.
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of such a concept, a numerical model of a PCS-based flat-plate solar thermal collector has been developed, presented and discussed. This model has been derived from the well-known Hottel–Whillier model, but several changes have been implemented so that a phase change of the heat transfer fluid can be handled, as well as the thermophysical properties of a non-Newtonian fluid, such as those of a PCS. The paper presents the main and auxiliary equations that have been introduced to modify the Hottel–Whillier model.
A numerical analysis conducted with the newly developed model is also presented in the paper. The aim of these simulations was to test the code and obtain a preliminary evaluation of the performance of the novel concept. Different (dynamic) boundary conditions (location, orientation, PCM concentration) were adopted to evaluate the performance of the PCS-based technology and compare it with that of a conventional solar thermal collector.
The outcomes of the simulations have proved model robustness and the possibility of using it for preliminary analysis. It was also shown that the adoption of the PCS as a heat transfer fluid can lead to an increase in solar energy exploitation of different magnitude according to the climate. The greatest benefit can be achieved for cold climates. The limitations of the analysis (e.g. fixed, non-optimal flow rate) are also discussed.},

This technology has been established since long time and continuous developments have been achieved as time passed by; significant improvements of flat plate solar thermal collectors are thus now limited. A novel approach to increase further the performance of this technology is based on the exploitation of the latent heat of the heat carrier fluid. In order to assess this strategy, a previously developed numerical model of flat plate solar thermal collector with slurry PCM as heat carrier is herewith used to simulate the technology. The characterization and energy performance of such a system are herewith presented, based on the outcome of the numerical analysis. The results demonstrate that the novel approach is able to improve the performance of the system under different boundary conditions and in different climates: the improvement in the instantaneous efficiency is in the range 5-10\%, while during the winter season the converted heat by the slurry PCM-based system is 20-40\% higher than that of a conventional water based solar collector, depending on the climates – the colder the climate, the larger the improvement.},

A silicone, light and lump oils were used. The water contents of the emulsions were 70, 80 and 90\%. The additive was an amino group modified silicone oil. No depression of freezing point was observed for the emulsions because of their hydrophobic properties. In order to determine the structure of the emulsions, their electrical resistances were measured. Moreover, components of the liquids separating from the emulsions were analyzed. The results indicated that one emulsion was a W/O type emulsion, while the other was an O/W type. Finally, adaptability of the two emulsions to ice storage was discussed, it was concluded that a high performance ice slurry could be formed by the W/O type emulsion.},

After some difficulties at the beginning, it is now possible to build systems, which operate as designed.

Actions in this direction are the design of new ice slurry generators, the development of new concepts for storage and mixing, etc. In this article a short review of the basic research on ice slurries is presented.

In theoretical analysis made about the evaporative supercooling, we ameliorate the traditional evaporation model to predict the temperature variation. To the experimental research, we adopted particle dynamics analyzer and infrared camera to examine the physical process, and it got ice with this new method.

The different ice slurry generation methods were reviewed. A super-cooling ice slurry generator type was experimentally tested and compared with a traditional scraped surface type. Some interesting advantages were observed in case of super-cooling type, developed in this paper. The stable operating range was slightly smaller compared with the traditional scraped surface type, and heat transfer coefficients were somewhat smaller due to smaller amount of generated ice fraction as common super-cooling type.

The finite difference method is utilized to solve the heat transfer problem, and the source term method is employed to handle the absorbed latent heat. An experimental example of a cylindrical cell is used to test this model. From a comparison with the experimental result, the computed cooling curve is found to be very close to the experimental one.},

In order to solve these problems, an improved ice producing system with assisting liquid desiccant evaporative supercooled water is proposed. The improved system adds an evaporative precooling subsystem of water. The dehumidified air entering ice producing chamber is cooled by the cooling water of system itself rather than mechanical regeneration cycle compared to the original system. The new system could realize cascade utilization of the low humidity ratio air. The amelioration can not only improve the ice producing efficiency, but also further reduce the dependence of the system on electric energy. The evaporative cooling characteristics of water droplets were analyzed by theoretical model and the experiment. The temperature variation of droplets predicted by theoretical calculation was basically consistent with the experiment. Finally the performance analysis of system has been made. Compared with the traditional supercooled water method, the ice producing rate of the improved system can increase by 33.8\% under certain working conditions.},

Moreover, shearing work to remove ice from the wall surface and surface energies of the wall and ice were calculated by the shearing stress and contact angles, respectively. And adhesion energy at an interface between ice and the wall was also calculated by the calculated surface energies. And then, influence of heat transfer and interfacial phenomena on ice adhesion was discussed to clarify the mechanism of ice adhesion.},

Ice slurry could be formed by cooling the emulsion without ice adhesion to a cooling wall because of its structural feature. However, it was found that propagation of supercooling dissolution of the emulsion hardly started and the propagation rate was much slower. In this study, in order to promote propagation of supercoolng dissolution of the emulsion without ice nucleus charging, the DC voltage is applied to the emulsion during the cooling process.

	abstract = {Molecular inclusion compounds called clathrate hydrates are a common concern in oil and gas pipelines, as they cause disruption to production. These crystalline compounds are over 80 mol\% water and are often only stable at high pressures and low temperatures. As a means to understand the rheology of clathrate hydrates, we investigated ice slurries, in crude oil, as a simple analogy to clathrate hydrates. A series of water-in-oil emulsions were prepared at different volume fractions of water, ranging from 0.10 to 0.70. Water used in the samples was deionized watger or a 3.5 wt\% NaCl brine solution. The emulsions were cooled to - 10 ° C and the viscosity and yield stress were analyzed as a function of time after nucleation.
No yield stresses were observed at volume fractions below 0.2 for fresh water and 0.3 for brine solution. In the fresh water system, the yield stress varied with increasing volume fraction. Between volume fractions of 0.25–0.55, yield stresses were on the order of 300 Pa, and at larger volumer fractions (0.6–0.7) yield stress quickly increased to an unmeasurable value (greater than 3000 Pa, the instrument’s limit). In the brine system, yield stress increased with volume fraction of water. After formation of ice, flow was stopped and the system was “annealed”. During the “annealing” period, the magnitude of complex viscosity of the fresh water system reached a peak value after two hours, decreased for approximately four hours, and then changed little for the next forty hours. The yield stress during “annealing” mimicked the trend of the magnitude of complex viscosity. In the brine system, the magnitude of complex viscosity increased over the first three hours, then changed little. However, the yield stress decreased as the “annealing” time increased. Following the measurements of yield stress, the slurry was conditioned at 500 s - 1 and the apparent viscosity was analyzed as a function of shear rate. At volume fractions greater than 0.10 the slurry was found to be shear thinning and exhibited a viscosity increase compared to the initial emulsion.},

The effects of the material of the cooling surface and the thermal resistance of the wall on the ice formation process were clarified. If the heat flux of the wall was less than a critical value, slurry ice was formed without adhesion to the cooling surface.

	abstract = {Heat pumps have been promoted as energy-efficient heating and cooling systems. However, in the heating mode, heat pump performance is often significantly degraded by the frost layer that forms on the fin surface of the heat exchanger due to the low temperature of the outdoor unit. In this research, we experimentally investigated the thermal performance and frosting behavior at various locations on a plate-fin and tube heat exchanger with respect to refrigerant flow direction (counter-flow and parallel-flow) and fin surface treatment (bare, hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and hybrid). On the bare heat exchanger, the frost growth was more uniform with a counter-flow than with a parallel-flow, and thus the overall heat transfer rate was higher under counter-flow condition. The performance difference between the counter-flow and parallel-flow conditions became more significant when the heat exchanger was operated at lower refrigerant temperature and air velocity. Although the initial heat transfer rate of the hydrophilic unit was the highest among the surface-treated heat exchangers, this unit also suffered a dramatic reduction in the heat transfer rate because of the fast frost growth and non-uniform frosting behavior on its rear side. On the other hand, although the hydrophobic heat exchanger had a slightly lower initial heat transfer rate than the hydrophilic unit, it exhibited a consistent heat transfer rate throughout the experiment, owing to the frost retardation effect and the relatively uniform frosting behavior on its rear side. Each of the hybrid hydrophilic–hydrophobic surface-treated heat exchangers showed a lesser reduction of the heat transfer rate than the hydrophilic unit, and a higher initial heat transfer rate than the hydrophobic unit.},

It is found that the hydrophilic surface mainly influences the frosting behavior, while the hydrophobic surface has some influence on the defrosting behavior. In view of the frosting, a surface-treated heat exchanger with either hydrophilic or hydrophobic characteristic shows little improvement in the thermal performance rather than the bare aluminum heat exchanger. The results reveal that the heat exchanger with a hydrophobic surface treatment is more effective in view of the defrosting efficiency and time. The amount of residual water on the surface-treated heat exchangers is shown to be smaller than that of the bare heat exchanger. Therefore further improvements on the performance of re-operations are expected.},

In this paper, three types of fin-tube heat exchangers with different surface characteristics were prepared and the effects of the surface characteristic on the frosting and defrosting behaviors of the heat exchangers were investigated experimentally. It was found that the surface characteristic had an obvious effect on the frost layer growth. The frost thickness and mass of the superhydrophobic heat exchanger were 17.1\% and 28.8\% less than those of the bare heat exchanger. What is more, the superhydrophobic heat exchanger showed the lowest air-side pressure drop and the best heat transfer during the frosting process. The effects of the surface characteristic on the energy consumption and time for frost melting were significant. When the frost layer melted completely, the retained water formed a thin water film on the surfaces of the hydrophilic fins while only some small spherical droplets stayed on the surfaces of the superhydrophobic fins. The least retained water on the superhydrophobic heat exchanger can reduce the energy consumption for evaporation and improve the defrosting efficiency.},

	abstract = {This research studies the heat transfer characteristic during ice formation of a direct contact heat transfer between carbon dioxide and water mixture. This research is divided into two parts. For the first part, the low temperature carbon dioxide, between − 15 and − 60 °C, is injected into water initially at 28 °C and exchanges heat directly. The flow rate of carbon dioxide is varied between 0.003 and 0.017 kg/s while the volume of water is between 1 and 3 L. From the experiment, it is found that the effectiveness of the direct contact heat transfer between the carbon dioxide and the water is closed to 100\%. Moreover, the lumped model is found to be used for predicting the temperature of water and the mass of ice formation quite well.
However, for this technique, the blockage of ice around the injector always occurs. To avoid this problem, slurry ice is considered instead of pure ice. In the second part of this work, the thermal behavior of the slurry ice by direct contact heat transfer technique between carbon dioxide and water mixture is investigated. Compressor oil and Tween 60 are mixed with water for making slurry ice and it is found that the suitable composition is water/oil/Tween 60 at 100/6/1 by volume. Again, the lumped model can be used for predicting the temperature of water mixture and the mass of slurry ice quite well.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges of ice slurry generation using a heat exchanger is to overcome the risk of choking. The nucleation usually appears after a supercooling state that remains a key aspect of this technology. In order to focus on this crucial problem, the crystallization of a water ethanol solution was studied in a transparent tubular heat exchanger. Our experiments consisted in cooling the solution until ice slurry formation. Flow visualization permitted mainly to determine the conditions of crystallization according to the flow rate. A limited range of flow rate permitted to obtain the desired ice slurry quality. The heterogeneous crystallization appeared on the wall and dendrites began to develop before being carried away by the solution. Experiments also indicated that dendrites growth from the freezing front upstream in the counter flow direction. The velocity of this retro-propagation phenomenon was estimated using an image analysis tool. Temperature measurements also provided important information on this retro-propagation. Selected process parameters have to be properly adjusted (flow rate, wall properties …). This technology has been patented by the CNRS in selected European countries and in the USA.},

The freezing process of food matrices is related to their high water content and its metamorphoses into ice on cooling. The final quality of the frozen product is highly depended on the ice crystal morphology because it can cause irreversible damage on the microstructure of the food matrix. Supercooling and ice nucleation temperature need to be controlled both in suppressing and inducing the solidification to improve technological processes such as freeze drying, freeze concentration, cryopreservation, ice formation and cold-energy storage both in food industry and domestic preservation. However, the mechanism of freezing is not yet well known and it is affected by several factors. Several emerging technologies have been recently proposed for ice nucleation control during freezing. This review article is focused on the alternative freezing methods such as ultrasound waves, magnetic, electric, and electromagnetic field assisted freezing.
