	abstract = {A new kind of functional surfaces with particular characteristics, i.e., superhydrophobic surfaces, has recently been developed and applied in many fields, such as airplane, wind turbine, electric power line, photovoltaic cell, heat exchanges, ice slurry generator, and so on. The freezing delay and ice-accumulation avoiding on the surfaces are important to keep stable working condition for these devices. The frictional pressure loss of flow through the tubes or channels with superhydrophobic surfaces is much smaller than that through those without superhydrophobic surfaces. Both the boiling and condensation heat transfer performances on superhydrophobic surfaces can be enhanced. The superhydrophobic surfaces have potential applications and are worthy further investigations. We provide here a review of the fabrications, characterization and the emerging energy-related applications of superhydrophobic surfaces on the basis of the recent progresses of the research and development in this field. The fabrication of superhydrophobic surface, in particular a recently developed SLIPS (slippery liquid-infused porous surface), is summarized. The focuses are placed on the particular characteristics of superhydrophobic surfaces and their applications in energy-related fields. The further research topics are also clarified to promote the future applications.},

Frost mass and thickness growth rates, corresponding coil heat transfer rates, capacity degradation, and air-side pressure drop for five microchannel coils with different surface coatings were measured and discussed. The experimental data showed that the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface coated coils considered in the present work accumulated frost on the heat transfer surfaces with visible difference in the type, appearance, and patterns of the frost. The duration of the frosting cycle, the heat transfer rate, and air-side pressure drop were similar to the ones of a louvered aluminum fin microchannel heat exchanger with uncoated surfaces. For the operating conditions tested in this work, hydrophobic and hydrophilic coatings on microchannel coils affected the heat transfer capacity in frosting conditions by up to 15\%.},

Besides the parallel between the icephobicity and superhydrophobicity for water/ice repellency, there are similarities on other levels including the hydrophobic effect/hydrophobic interactions, mechanisms of protein folding and ice crystal formation. In this paper, we report how ice adhesion is different from water using force balance analysis, and why superhydrophobic surfaces are not necessary icephobic. We also present experimental data on anti-icing of various surfaces and suggest a definition of icephobicity, which is broad enough to cover a variety of situations relevant to de-icing including low adhesion strength and delayed ice crystallization and bouncing.},

Understanding (and counteracting) surface icing brings with it significant scientific challenges that requires interdisciplinary knowledge from diverse scientific fields such as nucleation thermodynamics and heat transfer, fluid dynamics, surface chemistry, and surface nanoengineering. Here we discuss key aspects and findings related to the physics of ice formation on surfaces and show how such knowledge could be employed to rationally develop surfaces with extreme resistance to icing (extraordinary icephobicity). Although superhydrophobic surfaces with micro-, nano-, or (often biomimetic) hierarchical roughnesses have shown in laboratory settings (under certain conditions) excellent repellency and low adhesion to water down to temperatures near or below the freezing point, extreme icephobicity necessitates additional important functionalities. Other approaches, such as lubricant-impregnated surfaces, exhibit both advantages and serious limitations with respect to icing. In all, a clear path toward passive surfaces with extreme resistance to ice formation remains a challenge, but it is one well worth undertaking. Equally important to potential applications is scalable surface manufacturing and the ability of icephobic surfaces to perform reliably and sustainably outside the laboratory under adverse conditions. Surfaces should possess mechanical and chemical stability, and they should be thermally resilient. Such issues and related research directions are also addressed in this article.},

	abstract = {The accretion of ice can cause damage in applications ranging from power lines and shipping decks, to wind turbines and rail infrastructure. In particular on aircraft, it can change aerodynamic characteristics, greatly affecting the flight safety. Commercial aircraft are therefore required to be equipped with de-icing devices, such as heating mats over the wings. The application of icephobic coatings near the leading edge of a wing can in theory reduce the high power requirements of heating mats, which melt ice that forms there. Such coatings are effective in preventing the accretion of runback ice, formed from airborne supercooled droplets, or the water that the heating mats generate as it is sheared back over the wing's upper surface. However, the durability and the practicality of applying them over a large wing surface have been prohibitive factors in deploying this technology so far. Here, we evaluated the ice adhesion strength of four non-conductive coatings and seven thermally conductive coatings by shearing ice samples from coated plates by spinning them in a centrifuge device. The durability of the coating performance was also assessed by repeating the tests, each time regrowing ice samples on the previously-used coatings. Contact angle parameters of each coating were tested for each test to determine influence on ice adhesion strength. The results indicate that contact angle hysteresis is a crucial parameter in determining icephobicity of a coating and hydrophobicity is not necessarily linked to icephobicity.},

	abstract = {Ice formation on surfaces and structures produces damage and inefficiencies that negatively impact all manners of activities. Not surprisingly, for a long time, an unmet challenge has been to design materials capable of minimizing or even eliminating the formation of ice on the surface of the material. In recent years, there were significant efforts to develop such ice-phobic surfaces by building on the advances made with superhydrophobic materials since these, by definition, tend to repel water. However, a robust response includes the ability to deter the formation of ice when a substrate colder than the freezing temperature is exposed either to impacting water droplets or water vapor (i.e., frost formation). In the latter case, superhydrophobic surfaces in high humidity conditions were shown to allow significant ice accumulation. Consequently, a new design idea was needed. In this issue of ACS Nano, it is shown how a liquid-infiltrated porous solid, where the liquid strongly wets and is retained within the material, has many of the properties desired for an ice-phobic substrate. The composite material exhibits low contact angle hysteresis so only small forces are needed to provoke droplets to slide off of a cold substrate. This new slippery surface shows many characteristics required for ice-phobicity, and a method is demonstrated for applying this kind of material as a coating on aluminum. Ice may have met its match.},

The coatings were prepared by spin-coating or dip coating and used organosilane, fluoropolymer or silicone rubber as a top layer. Artificially created glaze ice, similar to the naturally accreted one, was deposited on the nanostructured surfaces by spraying supercooled water microdroplets (average size ∼80μm) in a wind tunnel at subzero temperature (−10°C). The ice adhesion strength was evaluated by spinning the samples in a centrifuge at constantly increasing speed until ice delamination occurred. The results show that the anti-icing properties of the tested materials deteriorate, as their surface asperities seem to be gradually broken during icing/de-icing cycles. Therefore, the durability of anti-icing properties appears to be an important point for further research. It is also shown that the anti-icing efficiency of the tested superhydrophobic surfaces is significantly lower in a humid atmosphere, as water condensation both on top and between surface asperities takes place, leading to high values of ice adhesion strength. This implies that superhydrophobic surfaces may not always be ice-phobic in the presence of humidity, which can limit their wide use as anti-icing materials.},

This review is dedicated to illustrating the fundamental characteristics of underwater superhydrophobicity, introducing novel and effective strategies for robust design and regulation, and to providing an overview of the state-of-the-art engineering applications in drag reduction and cavitation/boiling control. First, the underlying mechanisms of wetting transition on superhydrophobic surfaces submerged underwater induced by physical phenomena including pressurization, air diffusion, fluid flow, and condensation are reviewed. The influence of the closed/open state of entrapped air cavities is differentiated. Landmark experiments demonstrating wetting transition mechanisms are surveyed. Then, novel strategies for designing robust superhydrophobic surfaces are summarized, including hierarchical, reentrant, lubricant-infused, and mechanically durable structures. Moreover, strategies for superhydrophobicity regulation are introduced, which are classified into two types: self-healing and dewetting, based on the failure regime (surface damage or meniscus collapse). The current state-of-the-art engineering applications in drag reduction and cavitation/boiling control are comprehensively reviewed.

The drag reduction rate reached as high as 15\%. The fabrication of superhydrophobic coatings on a large area of submarine model surfaces was realized by immobilizing hydrophobic copper particles onto a precross-linked polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface. The pre-cross-linking time was optimized at 20 min to obtain good superhydrophobicity for the underwater drag reduction effect by investigating the effect of pre-cross-linking on surface wettability and water adhesive property.

The adhesion strength of glaze ice (similar to that deposited during “freezing rain”) is used as a measure of ice-releasing properties. The results show that the ice-repellent properties of the materials deteriorate during icing/deicing cycles, as surface asperities appear to be gradually damaged. It is also shown that the anti-icing efficiency of superhydrophobic surfaces is significantly lower in a humid atmosphere, as water condensation both on top of and between surface asperities takes place, leading to significantly larger values of ice adhesion strength. This work thus shows that superhydrophobic surfaces are not always ice-repellent and their use as anti-ice materials may therefore be limited.},

	abstract = {Ice-repellent coatings can have significant impact on global energy savings and improving safety in many infrastructures, transportation, and cooling systems. Recent efforts for developing ice-phobic surfaces have been mostly devoted to utilizing lotus-leaf-inspired superhydrophobic surfaces, yet these surfaces fail in high-humidity conditions due to water condensation and frost formation and even lead to increased ice adhesion due to a large surface area. We report a radically different type of ice-repellent material based on slippery, liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS), where a stable, ultrasmooth, low-hysteresis lubricant overlayer is maintained by infusing a water-immiscible liquid into a nanostructured surface chemically functionalized to have a high affinity to the infiltrated liquid and lock it in place. We develop a direct fabrication method of SLIPS on industrially relevant metals, particularly aluminum, one of the most widely used lightweight structural materials. We demonstrate that SLIPS-coated Al surfaces not only suppress ice/frost accretion by effectively removing condensed moisture but also exhibit at least an order of magnitude lower ice adhesion than state-of-the-art materials. On the basis of a theoretical analysis followed by extensive icing/deicing experiments, we discuss special advantages of SLIPS as ice-repellent surfaces: highly reduced sliding droplet sizes resulting from the extremely low contact angle hysteresis. We show that our surfaces remain essentially frost-free in which any conventional materials accumulate ice. These results indicate that SLIPS is a promising candidate for developing robust anti-icing materials for broad applications, such as refrigeration, aviation, roofs, wires, outdoor signs, railings, and wind turbines.},

	abstract = {Ice repellent coatings have been studied and keenly sought after for many years, where any advances in the durability of such coatings will result in huge energy savings across many fields. Progress in creating anti-ice and anti-frost surfaces has been particularly rapid since the discovery and development of slippery, liquid infused porous surfaces (SLIPS). Here we use SLIPS-coated differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) pans to investigate the effects of the surface modification on the nucleation of supercooled water. This investigation is inherently different from previous studies which looked at the adhesion of ice to SLIPS surfaces, or the formation of ice under high humidity conditions. Given the stochastic nature of nucleation of ice from supercooled water, multiple runs on the same sample are needed to determine if a given surface coating has a real and statistically significant effect on the nucleation temperature. We have cycled supercooling to freezing and then thawing of deionized water in hydrophilic (untreated aluminum), hydrophobic, superhydrophobic, and SLIPS-treated DSC pans multiple times to determine the effects of surface treatment on the nucleation and subsequent growth of ice. We find that SLIPS coatings lower the nucleation temperature of supercooled water in contact with statistical significance and show no deterioration or change in the coating performance even after 150 freeze–thaw cycles.},

	abstract = {Ice formation can have catastrophic consequences for human activity on the ground and in the air. Here we investigate water freezing delays on untreated and coated surfaces ranging from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic and use these delays to evaluate icephobicity. Supercooled water microdroplets are inkjet-deposited and coalesce until spontaneous freezing of the accumulated mass occurs. Surfaces with nanometer-scale roughness and higher wettability display unexpectedly long freezing delays, at least 1 order of magnitude longer than typical superhydrophobic surfaces with larger hierarchical roughness and low wettability. Directly related to the main focus on heterogeneous nucleation and freezing delay of supercooled water droplets, the observed ensuing crystallization process consisted of two distinct phases: one very rapid recalescent partial solidification phase and a subsequent slower phase. Observations of the droplet collision process employed for the continuous liquid mass accumulation up to the point of ice formation reveal a previously unseen atmospheric-pressure, subfreezing-temperature regime for liquid-on-liquid bounce. On the basis of the entropy reduction of water near a solid surface, we formulate a modification to the classical heterogeneous nucleation theory, which predicts the observed freezing delay trends. Our results bring to question recent emphasis on super water-repellent surface formulations for ice formation retardation and suggest that anti-icing design must optimize the competing influences of both wettability and roughness.},

To investigate the icephobic properties of different coatings, ice adhesion measurements were performed with a 0° cone test to determine ice adhesion strengths between coating and ice. Various coatings with different icephobic properties were investigated, e.g., hydrophilic and hydrophobic coatings, sol–gel based coatings containing fluorinated compounds and viscoelastic rubbers, as well as commercially available icephobic products. The coatings currently used on wind turbines showed an adhesion to ice that is comparable to that of bare aluminium; meaning a quite high adhesion to ice. Very low adhesion values were obtained in the case of coatings consisting of viscoelastic elastomers. Additionally, the influence of surface roughness on ice adhesion has been examined. Aluminium pins were chemically and mechanically roughened and their ice adhesion was determined. These pins were further coated with a fluorine-containing coating in order to study the influence of minimized surface energies. Shear stress of those coated pins was considerably reduced, however, rough surfaces showed higher ice adhesion than smooth ones.},

The morphology, surface chemical composition and wettability of the prepared copolymer films were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and water contact angle measurement. Delayed icing time and ice shear strength of the films were also detected for the icephobic purpose. The surface morphologies of the copolymers were different from those of the bulk because of the migration of the PMTFPS segments to the air interface during the film formation. Maximal delayed icing time (186s at −15°C) and reduction of the ice shear strength (301±10kPa) which was significantly lower than that of polyacrylates (804±37kPa) were achieved when the content of PMTFPS-MAI was 20wt\%. The icephobicity of the copolymers was attributed primarily to the enrichment of PMTFPS on the film surface and synergistic effect of both silicone and fluorine. Thus, the results show that the PMTFPS–b-polyacrylate copolymer can be used as icephobic coating materials potentially.},

High-speed photography was applied to study water droplet impact dynamics on these surfaces. It was found that single and successive water droplets could rebound on the superhydrophobic surface and roll off at a tilt angle larger than 30° under an extremely condensing weather condition (−10 °C and relative humidity of 85–90\%). In addition, the superhydrophobic surface showed a strong icephobic property, the ice adhesion on this surface was only 13\% of that on the superhydrophilic surface, though they had a similar nano/microtopological structure. Moreover, this superhydrophobic surface displayed an excellent durability of the icephobic property. The ice adhesion only increased to 20\% and 16\% of that on the superhydrophobic surface after the surface was undergone 20 icing/ice-breaking cycles and 40 icing/ice-melting cycles, respectively. Surface profile and XPS studies on these surfaces indicated a minor damage of the surface nano/microstructure and the coating layer upon these multiple ice-breaking and ice-melting processes.

In this study, we have developed a cryo-preparation method to visualize the contact area between liquids and superhydrophobic biological surfaces by scanning electron microscopy. Aqueous liquids that do not crystallize during freezing, such as glycerol and phosphoric acid, were used. First, the samples in contact with the liquid droplets were cooled with liquid nitrogen. After this, the droplets were separated and the contact areas on the frozen droplets were visualized by scanning electron microscopy. The contact areas of droplets on various biological and artificial surfaces with microstructure, nanostructure, and hierarchical structures are shown in detail. It could be shown that spaces between nanostructures were not penetrated by the droplet, which rested only on top of the structures. Measurements of the contact areas showed the largest reduction in the solid−liquid contact area on hierarchically structured leaf surfaces. On these surfaces, the droplets are in the “Cassie state” at both levels of surface structuring. On plant surfaces, the varying height of the epidermal cells and the surface relief caused considerable variations in the contact between droplet and surface. The examples demonstrate that this new approach provides detailed insights into the wetting behavior of surfaces in the Cassie state with partial contact with the liquid.},

The static and dynamic anti-icing behaviors of the as-prepared aluminum surface in different conditions were systematically investigated with a self-made device and artificial climate laboratory. Results showed that the as-prepared surface can mitigate freezing in glaze ice. Only several isolated ice points formed on the surface in glaze ice after 50min. Due to the superhydrophobicity of the as-prepared aluminum surface, cold water sprayed on the surface aggregated into large drops and rolled off the surface before freezing, thus protecting the surface against excessive ice accumulation. The surface morphology and crystal structure of the samples were also characterized by scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectrometry and X-ray diffraction. This study offers insight into understanding the anti-icing behavior of the superhydrophobic aluminum surface and may favor the application of structured aluminum surface in power transmission lines against ice accumulation.},

Empirical grid maps based on different volumes of H2O2/acid were presented, revealing a wettability gradient from “hydrophobic” to “rose effect” and finally to “lotus effect”. Surface grafting has been demonstrated to be realized only on the oxidized area. As-prepared superhydrophobic surfaces exhibited excellent anti-icing properties according to the water-dripping test under overcooled conditions and the artificial “steam-freezing” (from 50 °C with 90\% humidity to the −20 °C condition) test. In addition, the surfaces could withstand peeling with 3M adhesive tape at least 70 times with an applied pressure of 31.2 kPa, abrasion by 400 grid SiC sandpaper for 110 cm under 16 kPa, or water impacting for 3 h without losing superhydrophobicity, suggesting superior mechanical durability. Moreover, outstanding corrosion resistance and UV-durability were obtained on the prepared surface. This successful fabrication of a robust, anti-icing, UV-durable, and anticorrosion superhydrophobic surface could yield a prospective candidate for various practical applications.},

Here, we study the ice-adhesion properties of lubricant-impregnated textured surfaces. Force measurements show ice adhesion strength on textured surfaces impregnated with thermodynamically stable lubricant films to be higher than that on surfaces with excess lubricant. Systematic ice-adhesion measurements indicate that the ice-adhesion strength is dependent on texture and decreases with increasing texture density. Direct cryogenic SEM imaging of the fractured ice surface and the interface between ice and lubricant-impregnated textured surface reveal stress concentrators and crack initiation sites that can increase with texture density and result in lowering adhesion strength. Thus, lubricant-impregnated surfaces have to be optimized to outperform state-of-the-art icephobic treatments.},

Moreover, the low ice adhesion of the anti-icing coating can be maintained even when the temperature is lowered to -53 oC. The robustness and durability of the anti-icing coating are proved by the icing/de-icing experiments.

	abstract = {It is known that smooth, hydrophobic solid surfaces exhibit low ice adhesion values, which have been shown to approach a lower ice adhesion strength limit (∼150 {kPa}) defined by the water receding contact angle. To overcome this limit, we have designed self-lubricating icephobic coatings by blending polydimethylsiloxane ({PDMS})-poly(ethylene glycol) ({PEG}) amphiphilic copolymers into a polymer matrix. Such coatings provide low ice adhesion strength values (∼50 {kPa}) that can substantially reduce the lower bound of the ice adhesion strength achieved previously on smooth, hydrophobic solid surfaces. Different molecular mechanisms are responsible for the low ice adhesion strength attained by these two approaches. For the smooth hydrophobic surfaces, an increased water depletion layer thickness at the interface weakens the van der Waals’ interactions between the ice and the polymeric substrate. For the self-lubricating icephobic coatings, the {PEG} component of the amphiphilic copolymer is capable of strongly hydrogen bonding with water molecules. The surface hydrogen-bonded water molecules do not freeze, even at substantial levels of subcooling, and therefore serve as a self-lubricating interfacial liquid-like layer that helps to reduce the adhesion strength of ice to the surface. The existence of nonfrozen water molecules at the ice-solid interface is confirmed by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) spectroscopy.},

The use of coatings having amphiphilic surfaces for anti-icing applications has not been studied to a large extent although these types of coatings have more recently been studied for anti-fouling (AF)/foul release (FR) applications. Several polyurethane based amphiphilic coatings were prepared having variations in the composition as well as molecular weight of hydrophobic polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS), and hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG). Surface characterizations of the coatings revealed the presence of both PDMS and PEG moieties, implying amphiphilic surface characteristics. The icephobic properties of these coatings were evaluated to investigate if amphiphilic formulations can deter ice adhesion. Water absorption and barrier behaviors of these coatings and their correlation to anti-icing properties were also studied."

We introduce for this purpose the crystal affinity of a liquid, a simple measure of its propensity to accumulate local crystalline structures on cooling. This quantity is explicitly related to the high-temperature structural covariance between local fluctuations in crystal order and that of competing liquid structures: favoring a structure that, due to poor overlap properties, anticorrelates with crystalline order reduces the affinity of the liquid. Using a lattice model of a liquid, we show that this quantity successfully predicts the tendency of a liquid to either accumulate or suppress local crystalline fluctuations with increasing supercooling. We demonstrate that the crystal affinity correlates strongly with the crystal nucleation rate and the crystal-liquid interfacial free energy of the low-temperature liquid, making our theory a predictive tool to determine which amorphous structures enhance glass-forming ability.},
