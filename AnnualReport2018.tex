\section{Motivation}

Solar-ice systems are becoming more and more popular in Switzerland. However, state-of-the-art solar-ice systems have some disadvantages such as a usually higher cost compared to Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHP) if the same performance is desired. Therefore, research is still needed to bring robust solar-ice systems to the market with comparable cost and higher efficiency compared to GSHP solutions. 
The solar ice slurry system is a particular case of solar-ice systems. The main difference between them is that in the ice slurry concept the ice storage contains no heat exchangers, which reduces the system installation cost by \SI{10}{\%}. Moreover, the heat exchanger (supercooler) is always free of ice and thus has a higher efficiency compared to ice-on-coil heat exchangers (15\SI{10}{\%} higher at \SI{50}{\%} ice fraction) and there is no need to de-ice them compared to the thermal de-icing concept. A feasibility study carried out in the project Slurry-HP undertaken by SPF \citep{SlurryHp_2017} has shown that solar-ice systems based on the ice slurry heat pump using the supercooling approach have a high potential for cost reduction, while having a high energetic efficiency, especially for ice storage volumes of at least \SI{1}{m^3} per MWh of yearly heating demand, which corresponds well to ice storage volumes used today for multi-family buildings. Moreover, an ice slurry storage would allow to use existing rooms of the building efficiently since any shape and room size could store slurries if properly distributed.
Within Slurry-HP, the system energetic efficiencies, investment and heat generation costs were compared to the best performing simulated solar-ice configuration as well as to current GSHP systems. An example of the simulated system efficiencies and estimated heat generation cost for a single family house (SFH) in Z\"urich is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:solar-ice} with the corresponding reference cost for a GSHP (cost based on multiple offers from different companies). From Fig~\ref{fig:solar-ice} it can be observed that a solar ice slurry system with \SI{1.5}{m^2} of collector area and \SI{1}{m^3} of ice storage volume per MWh of heat demand has an efficiency (\si{\spf}) of 4.8 with lower heat generation cost compared to GSHP systems.

\section{Project objectives}

The overall goal of the Slurry-Store project is to experimentally investigate ice storages able to store and melt slurries with (solar) heat without using any stirring device.
The specific objectives of the project will be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design, build and test an ice slurry storage design able to achieve \SI{50}{\%} ice slurry fraction
    \item Develop and test an ice crystallizer for stable continuous ice slurry production of 6 hours
    \item Design, build and test two concepts for loading (icing)
    \item Design, build and test two concepts for unloading (melting)
    \item Develop a mathematical model for the ice slurry storage, implement it and validated within TRNSYS.
\end{itemize}

\section{Status and work carried out}

The project has been running since October 2020. In these two months we have carried out two main tasks. The first one is the design and preparation of the experimental set-up that we will use for the experimental work. A summary will be shown in section \ref{chapter_exp_setup}. The second task has been to focus on a literature review on ice slurry with special emphasis on the supercooling method, ice crystallizer and ice slurry storage. A summary of the literaure review is provided in section \ref{chapter_theory}. Both tasks are still ongoing and the presented work should be considered as preliminary results.
 

\section{Experimental set-up for supercooling ice production}
\label{chapter_exp_setup}


\noindent
 The goal of the described installation is to continuously produce ice slurry with an ice content of roughly \SI{2}{\%} of the mass flow at the tank inlet. Our goal is to achieve an ice fraction of \SI{50}{\%} in the tank itself. The design of the installation is based on the setup of a previous project, in which the supercooling capability of a coated flat plate heat exchanger was tested. The setup is schematically shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:exp_setup}. It consists of two separate piping loops: i) a loop with demineralized water (right) and ii) a glycol-water mixture loop with \SI{30}{\%} glycol content (left). The two loops are connected via a plate heat exchanger that acts as the supercooler. Both loops are designed from 1" plastic pipes and a flow rate from \SIrange{200}{2000}{l/h}.

\end{figure}

\noindent On the water circuit, the water is pumped from the ice storage and heated up to \SI{0.5}{\celsius} to ensure that no ice particles are pumped to the supercooler. The fluid is pumped using a radial pump "P\_W". After passing a static mixer that ensures the flow is well mixed, the mass flow rate is measured using a Coriolis mass flow meter. It then passes a filter with \SI{0.5}{mm} mesh size to remove possible solid particles before it reaches the supercooler. In this welded plate type heat exchanger, the water is cooled down to temperatures between \SIrange{0}{-2}{\celsius}, where icephobic coated surfaces are expected to delay the formation of ice. Directly after the supercooler, the supercooled water will be crystallized in the custom made device. A peltier module is installed in this device with a cooling capacity $>$~100~W, that is supposed to further cool the fluid locally at the peltier surface. The increased degree of supercooling is believed to be sufficient to promote crystallization at this very location. The crystallizer is crucial to prevent formation of ice in unwanted places, where the ice could block the pipe. Since ice is reported to propagate upstream along the pipe walls  \citep{mito_new_2002}, heat tracing will be used to locally increase the pipe walls above the freezing temperature. At the location of the crystallizer, the pipe diameter is increased to \si{3}{"} to reduce the flow velocity and balance the velocities of the ice front formation and the supercooled water flow. After the crystallizer, an ice slurry mixture with around \SI{2}{\%} ice content will flow to the tank. Between the crystallizer and the tank, a three way valve is placed. With this valve, a melting program can be used where warm water is sprayed from the top onto floating ice inside the tank. Two different options of introducing the slurries into the storage as  well as two options of melting the ice will be considered and experimentally evaluated.


The glycol loop is cooled using the air-cooled chiller IN 1030 T. Its mass flow is achieved with a chiller pump controlled by an MID. The temperature is controlled by the chiller using the PT-100 temperature probe TI-3 installed before the heat exchanger. 

Temperatures will be measured using seven 4-wire PT100 temperature sensors. Temperature sensors TI-2 to TI-5 are used to calculate the energy balance across the supercooling plate heat exchanger. TI-5 is also used to control the heat generated by the electric heater EI-H. The temperature sensor TI-H includes a machanical safety switch to prevent overheating in case the heater would run without flow or fluid. The temperature difference between TI-4 and TI-6 is used to check proper ice generation. A negative temperature in TI-4 and a temperature of \SI{0}{\celsius} in TI-6 would indicate a complete release of the  supercooling into latent heat. That is, a perfect ice crystallization process. A mismatch in the energy balance and the measurement in TI-4 will indicate early nucleation inside the supercooler or shortly after the supercooler. The electric current delivered to the pump  P\_W together with data from FI-W is used to detect blocked pipes. Once ice is detected, a melting program will be initiated. In this program, the temperature will be increased by the chiller reverting the cycle from cooling to heating. This will melt the ice formed on the heat exchanger.
