\section{Motivation}

Solar-ice systems are becoming more and more popular in Switzerland. However, state-of-the-art solar-ice systems have some disadvantages such as a usually higher cost compared to Ground Source Heat Pumps GSHP if the same performance is desired. Therefore, research is still needed to bring robust solar-ice systems to the market with comparable cost and higher efficiency with respect to ground-source heat pump solutions. 
The solar ice-slurry system is a particular case of solar-ice systems. The main difference between them is that in the ice slurry concept the ice storage contains no heat exchangers, which reduces the system installation cost by 10~\%. Moreover, the heat exchanger (supercooler) is always free of ice and thus has a higher efficiency compared to ice-on-coil (15~\% higher at 50~\% ice fraction) and there is no need to de-ice them compared to the thermal de-icing concept. A feasibility study carried out in the project Slurry HP undertaken by SPF \cite{SlurryHp_2017} has shown that solar-ice systems based on the ice slurry heat pump using the supercooling approach have a high potential for cost reduction, while having a high energetic efficiency, especially for ice storage volumes of at least \SI{1}{m^3} per MWh of yearly heating demand, which corresponds well to ice storage volumes used today for multi-family buildings. Moreover, an ice slurry storage would allow to use existing rooms of the building efficiently since any shape and room size could store slurries if properly distributed.
Within Slurry-HP, the system energetic efficiencies, investment and heat generation costs were compared to the best performing simulated solar-ice configuration as well as to current GSHP systems. An example of the simulated system efficiencies and estimated heat generation cost for a single family house (SFH) in Zurich is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:solar-ice} with the corresponding reference cost for a GSHP (cost based on different offers from companies). From Fig~\ref{fig:solar-ice} it can be observed that a solar ice-slurry system with \SI{1.5}{m^2} of collector area and \SI{1}{m^3} of ice storage volume per MWh of heat demand has an efficiency (\si{\spf}) of 4.8 with lower heat generation cost compared to GSHP systems.

\section{Project objectives}

The overall goal of the Slurry-Store project will be to experimentally investigate ice storages able to store and melt slurries with (solar) heat without using any mixing device.
The specific objectives of the project will be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design, built and test an ice slurry storage design able to achieve 50~\% ice slurry fraction
    \item Develop and test an ice releaser for stable continuous operation of 6 hours
    \item Design, built and test two concepts for loading (icing)
    \item Design, built and test two concepts for unloading (melting)
    \item Develop a mathematical formulation for the ice slurry storage, implement it and validated within TRNSYS.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
 The goal of the described installation is to continuously produce an ice  slurry with an ice content of roughly 2~\% at the tank inlet, and up to 50\% of ice in the tank itself. Its design is based on the setup of a previous project, in which the supercooling capability of a coated double tube heat exchanger was tested. The setup consists of two separate piping loops: A water loop with demineralized water and a glycol-water loop with 30\% glycol as refrigerant. The two loops are connected via a plate heat exchanger that acts as supercooler of the water. Both loops are designed from 1" plastic pipes and a flow of \SIrange{200}{2000}{l/h}.


In the \textbf{Water-loop}. starting at the water/ice tank, the water is heated up to \SI{0.5}{\celsius} to ensure that no leftover ice particles from the tank can be found within the stream. The fluid is then pumped through the water loop using a radial pump "P\_W" (Grundfos CME). After passing a static mixer that ensures homogeneousity of the temperature in the flow, the mass of the flow is measured using a Coriolis mass flow meter (DN15, E+H, Promass E300, "FI-W"). It then passes a filter with \SI{0.5}{mm} mesh size (+GF+ Strainer Type 305) to remove possible solid particles before it reaches the supercooler. In this welded plate type heat exchanger (AlfaLaval), the water is cooled down to temperatures between \SIrange{0}{-2}{\celsius}, where coated supercooler walls are expected to prevent formation of ice. Directly after the supercooler, the supercooled water is crystallized in the custom made crystallizing pipe section. Parts of the water are cooled electrically using peltier modules to promote crystallization. This step is crucial to prevent formation of ice in unwanted places, where the ice could block the pipe. Since ice is reported to propagate upstream along the pipe walls  \citep{mito_new_2002}, heat tracing is used to locally increase the pipe walls above freezing temperature. At the location of the crystallizer, the pipe diameter is increased to \si{3}{"} to reduce the flow velocity to increase the time for ice to grow. The ice slurry then leaves the crystallizer and is passed on to the tank. Between the crystallizer and the tank, a tree way valve is placed. With this valve, a de-icing programm can be run, where warmed water is sprayed from the top onto floating ice inside the tank.


The \textbf{glycole loop} acts as the refrigerant, and is cooled using the heat pump IN 1030 T. Its flow is generated using a pump within the heat pump and controlled by a MID "FI-G". The temperature is controlled using PT-100 within the  heat pump and before and after the heat exchanger.

Temperatures are measured using seven 4-wire PT100 temperature indicators. TI-2 to -5 are used to generate an energy balance calculation across the supercooling plate heat exchanger. TI-5 is also used to control the heat generated by the heater EI-H. TI-H acts as safety instrument to prevent the heater from overheating if it sould run dry. The temperature difference between TI-4 and -5 is used to check proper ice generation. A negative temperature in -4 and a temperature of \SI{0}{\celsius} indicates complete release of superheating. A mismatch in the energy balance and the temperature in TI-4 can also indicate early nucleation inside or shortly after the supercooler. The electric current delivered to the pump  P\_W together with data from FI-W is used to detect blocked pipes, starting a de-icing program. In this program, the allowed heater temperature is raised and the chiller switches from cooling to heating, resulting in increased temperature in the heat exchanger and ultimately in melting of the blocking ice.
